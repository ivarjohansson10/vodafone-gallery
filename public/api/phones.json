        "<p><b>Makes a splash. Takes a splash.<br />\r\n </b>iPhone 7 reaches a new level of innovation and precision. The jet black finish is like nothing we've ever made. The enclosure is splash and water resistant. The Home button is completely re-engineered. And with a new unibody design that's seamless to the touch, iPhone 7 feels as amazing as it looks.</p>\r\n<p><b style=\"\">An entirely new camera enters the picture.<br />\r\n </b>iPhone is the most popular camera in the world. Now we've re-engineered that beloved camera, adding optical image stabilisation, an f/1.8 aperture and a six-element lens to make it even better for shooting photos and videos in low light. And with advanced new features like wide colour capture, your photos and Live Photos will look even more vibrant.</p>\r\n<p><b>The brightest, most colourful iPhone display yet.<br />\r\n </b>Almost everything you experience with your iPhone comes to life on its display. It's where you look at the photos, messages and countless other things that make up your day. The iPhone 7 display uses the same colour space as the digital cinema industry, so what you see will be noticeably more brilliant and vibrant. Because we all deserve a bit more brightness in our day.</p>\r\n<p><b style=\"\">The most powerful chip ever in a smartphone.<br />\r\n </b>iPhone 7 is supercharged by the most powerful chip ever in a smartphone. It's not just faster than any previous iPhone - it's also more efficient. That's because the A10 Fusion chip uses an all-new architecture that enables faster processing when you need it, and the ability to use even less power when you don't. And with the longest battery life ever in an iPhone, you can work at twice the speed of iPhone 6 and still enjoy more time between charges.</p>\r\n<p><b style=\"\">iPhone. Now in stereo.<br />\r\n </b>For the first time, iPhone comes with stereo speakers, delivering two times the audio output of iPhone 6s and increased dynamic range. So whether you're listening to music, watching videos or making speakerphone calls, iPhone 7 lets you crank it up. Way, way up.</p>\r\n<p><b style=\"\">EarPods. With a Lightning connector.<br />\r\n </b>iPhone 7 comes with EarPods that have a Lightning connector. But if you still want to listen through your old headphones, you can plug them in using a 3.5mm headphone jack adapter, also included.</p>\r\n<p><b style=\"\">Faster 4G LTE with the best worldwide roaming.<br />\r\n</b>iPhone 7 features 4G LTE Advanced, with speeds up to 450 Mbps for data downloads - over 50 per cent faster than iPhone 6s and three times faster than iPhone 6. And thanks to even more LTE bands, you'll have the best worldwide roaming available in a smartphone. Happy travels.</p>\r\n<p><b style=\"\">iOS 10. It's why there's nothing else like an iPhone.<br />\r\n</b>iOS 10 brings iPhone 7 to life in incredibly personal and powerful ways. The interface is beautiful and easy to use. Intelligent suggestions appear just when you need them. And advanced technologies protect your privacy and security.</p>\r\n"
